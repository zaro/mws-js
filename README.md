mws-js
======

This is a continuation of the unstable branch of https://github.com/eibbors/mws-js .
While having very nice ideas, it was incomplete and a bit buggy.
I needed only the products, orders and feeds APIs, so I have no idea what is the status
of the rest of the apis

I find Node.js an absolute pleasure to work with and made this rough
Marketplace web services client as one of my first projects. I still find it
beats the snot out of PHP, Java, or C# packages Amazon publishes.  
I use it for real-time integration and/or dashboards for e-commerce clients.
Note: there may be tons of bugs since I updated the formatting to be a lot
more user-friendly, but almost all of the documented functions and objects
should work fine and dandy like cotton candy.

Usage
=====

Simple example
--------------
Fetching a product info:
```
mws = require 'mws-js'

loginInfo = 
  locale: 'US'
  merchantId: 'XXXXXXX'
  marketplaceId: 'XXXXXXX'
  accessKeyId: 'XXXXXXX'
  secretAccessKey: 'XXXXX'

ASIN_ID = 'XXXXX' # This could be an array of IDs

client = new mws.products.Client(loginInfo)

client.getMatchingProductForId {idType: 'ASIN', ids: ASIN_ID}, (res) =>
	if res.error
		console.error res.error
	else if res.result
		console.log util.inspect(res.result,false,10)

```

You can have a look at test directory for more examples.
